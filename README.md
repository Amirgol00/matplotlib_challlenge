**Pymaceuticals Project**

**Overview**

This project, "Pymaceuticals," is a Python-based analysis focused on the effects of different anti-cancer treatmetns for squamos cell carcinoma (SCC), a comonly occuring form of skin cancer. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The data from these studies are stored in two datsets called 'Mouse_metadata' and 'Study_results'.

 The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook.

**Features**

Data Analysis: Detailed exploration and analysis of pharmaceutical data and animal (mouse) data.

Visualization: Implementation of various data visualization techniques using Pandas and Matplotlib to represent the findings effectively.

Statistical Testing: Utilization of statistical methods to validate the findings and find outliers in the data for specific treatments.

**Requirements**

To run this notebook, you need the following packages:


Pandas

Matplotlib

NumPy

Spicy.stats


Ensure these packages are installed in your Python environment. Also, you can change the file paths for the csv files if needed
